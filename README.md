# Airbnb_Gentrification_AMS
This project aims to identify gentrified neighbourhoods due to the presence of Airbnb rental markets. In particular, the script codes are used to obtain socioeconomic and housing physical infrastructure conditions of Amsterdammers' households. Moreover, an econometric exercise is designed to identify significant characteristics potentially related to higher rates in the housing rental market. The study uses the available information from 2007 to 2018.
